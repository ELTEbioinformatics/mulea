## urlchecket::url_check() results

Error: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
https://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/

My understanding is that th website should update its certificate but I did not
find any direct contact to the website maintainers where I could request this.

Error: 403: Forbidden

The other doi.org urls pass the checks I do not know why this doesn't but the
url seems to work.
